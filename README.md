## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Using HTML and CSS I recreated the JWLI site. I implemented Flexbox for help positioning elements within parent containers.

## Lessons Learned:

One aspect of this project that challenged me and forced me to think outside of the box was the footer. I had never done a footer with the style JWLI has, Flexbox was a huge help in this area and has proven time and time again to be a helpful tool.
